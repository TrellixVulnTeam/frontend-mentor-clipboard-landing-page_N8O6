## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Mobile-first design
- CSS Flexbox & Grid

### What I learned

I have finally learned how to use SASS in one small landing page, its folder structure and how to install it. Only the basics, but I have fun applying mixins, variables, and functions in this project.

### Continued Development

I need to understand more the use of mixins and functions. Another thing, is the usage of Flexbox and Grid.
